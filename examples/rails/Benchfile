# This should be used after vm is installed
# A vm should provide a default Benchfile
#
# We should have a toobelt cli method that initializes a benchfile
# something like `devbench init devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails`
# or `devbench init https://devbench.io/devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails`
#   1. Downloads vm if doesn't exist locally
#   2. Sets up default Benchfile in current directory
#   3. Downloads encrypted config file (like main user's aws credentials if creating ec2 instances)

# need a way for main user account to create encrypted files/probably from command line?
# They will have to have a local settings file, then
# `devbench settings create chrisconley --public-key ~/Downloads/chris.pub --settings ~/.settings.json`
# If this creates a file in s3, we're going to need to create a temporary federated user
# so the file can be uploaded

#How to handle version control?
# Updating vm
# `devbench update`
#   1. Displays any backwards incompatible changes
#   2. Downloads new vm
#   3. Displays new options


launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails'
launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails', :ec2 # ec2/devbench options should be on command line
launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails', :devbench

# Benchfile should provide configuration details for what
# jobs/services to run
startup do
  rbenv do
    version '2.0.0-p0'
  end
  run :mysql do
    host 'localhost'
  end
  start :rails
end

# And build details?
# Or should this go in a Buildfile?
build do
  # All these commands get run in VM?

  # Do we need to support a build directory?
  app_dir '/devbench-web' # Where to symlink/rsync to
  jshint
  bundle
  restart rails server

  # This should probably be a command line option
  start_tunnel # Can we support force ssl in development
end

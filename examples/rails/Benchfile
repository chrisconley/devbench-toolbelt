# This should be used after vm is installed
# A vm should provide a default Benchfile
#
# We should have a toobelt cli method that initializes a benchfile
# something like `devbench init devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails`
# or `devbench init https://devbench.io/devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails`
#   1. Downloads vm if doesn't exist locally
#   2. Sets up default Benchfile in current directory
#   3. Downloads encrypted config file (like main user's aws credentials if creating ec2 instances)

# need a way for main user account to create encrypted files/probably from command line?
# They will have to have a local settings file, then
# `devbench settings create joedirt --settings ~/.settings.json`
#   * This will download the public key that joedirt uploaded when creating his account so the file can be encrypted
# If this creates a file in s3, we're going to need to create a temporary federated user
# so the file can be uploaded

#How to handle version control?
# Updating vm
# `devbench update`
#   1. Displays any backwards incompatible changes
#   2. Downloads new vm
#   3. Displays new options

# Starting the VM
# `devbench start`
#   * Launch the VM if is not already running
#   * Run Configuration/startup
#   * Run Build


launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails'
launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails', :ec2 # ec2/devbench options should be on command line
launch 'devbench/ubuntu-precise-rails', :devbench

# Benchfile should provide configuration details for what
# jobs/services to run
startup do
  #rbenv do # This could actually go in build, so multiple rubies can be support for each project
    #version '2.0.0-p0'
  #end
  # eff the dsl for simple things
  shell 'rbenv global 2.0.0-p0'

  run :mysql do
    host 'localhost'
  end

  # Need a way to set environment variables?
  env 'MONGOHQ_URL', devbench[:mongo_url]
end

# And build details?
# Or should this go in a Buildfile? or just a Rakefile? Maybe we don't even need this 
# right now?
build do
  # All these commands get run in VM?
  # Maybe the watcher can even be run in the VM? Which automatically gets run when starting

  # Do we need to support a build directory?
  app_dir '/devbench-web' # Where to symlink/rsync to
  jshint
  bundle
  restart rails server

  # This should probably be a command line option
  start_tunnel # Can we support force ssl in development
end
